title: Adding New Projects To Simplefolio
---

Adding a new project with _Simplefolio_ is, well, simple.

1. Create a new file with the project's date and name. It should look something like `2010-10-31-halloween-logo.markdown`.
2. Write whatever you want using either markdown, textile or just plain ol' HTML.
3. Add it to the `_posts` folder in Simplefolio.
4. Commit changes and push the repository to GitHub.

That's really all there is to it.
