title: How does GitHub handle a jekyll site?
---

So, I'm sitting here, trying to make a cool, flexible system for digital artists to be able to have a nice system which helps them create a portfolio that both looks nice and is responsive, when I realize: "Why don't we just give them a templated [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) site?"

It makes sense, doesn't it? Sure, we can just give them a big bunch of HTML files, but they'd have to do a bunch of copying and pasting.

### What do we gain from Jekyll?
1. Information reuse. The artist simply has to fill out `_config.yml` and they should be good to go.
2. No HTML. They can write all their content, and the system will enforce the web standards. Sounds like a win-win.
3. Easier to update. Once the artist gets over the hurdle of working with markdown or textile, all they have to do is hop on GitHub, create a new file, and go.
